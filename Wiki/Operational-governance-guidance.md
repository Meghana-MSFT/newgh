## Who will maintain the app inside the organization.
- IT admin or tenant admin should maintain the application.

## How will Microsoft support issues
- Please, report the issue [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-newemployeeonboarding/issues/new)

## How frequently we release updates.
- Teams app does not require maintenance. We do version updates as well, which can be easily updated if customers come with new requirements. After deployment, our assumption is that only learning content in SharePoint may need refresh occasionally. At the time of deployment, admin will configure a group for new hires. All that needs to happen with time is that new hires get added to that group. App automatically picks up their manager from AAD and installs the app for new hire and manager if not already installed.
